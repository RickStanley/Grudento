# Grudento
This is yet another sticky notes app.

## Goals
- Parity with Windows' sticky notes;
- supersede Window's sticky notes;
- have **actual** sticky notes (pin on top/always on top);
- be every bit compatible with every markdown engine (two-way copying and pasting should be trivial);
- simplicity like [notekit](https://github.com/blackhole89/notekit/), [gnote](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gnote) and etc.

## Non-goals
- All-in replacement for notebook's daily organizers (like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/));
- Cloud sync;

## Q & A

### Why not GTK, Qt, Flutter?
I'm new to rust. I would like to get into it. I know TS. Tauri seems one of the good ways to start.

But I've grown more and more tired of JS/HTML/CSS stack over the years, mainly because of performance compared to native applications. So I'll build this just as POC and, if needed, I'll try another stack. Maybe full Rust with Druid framework.
